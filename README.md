Heart disease prediction with blockchain

ðŸ’“ HeartBeatLink: Decentralized Heart Disease Prediction
This project demonstrates a hybrid approach to heart disease prediction, integrating off-chain AI with Chainlink Functions for verifiable on-chain data recording.

Project Overview
Off-chain ML: A Flask app predicts heart disease using a Random Forest Classifier.
On-chain Recording: Prediction results are sent to a Solidity smart contract which uses Chainlink Functions to securely process and record them as a state change on the blockchain.
This project meets the Chainlink hackathon requirement by utilizing Chainlink Functions to perform a state change on-chain based on a Chainlink interaction.

Key Files & Chainlink Integration
The core Chainlink integration is found in these files:

app.py:

Initiates the Chainlink Functions request by calling the requestPredictionProcessing function on the smart contract after an ML prediction.
Link to app.py (Specific lines for Web3/Chainlink interaction will be highlighted in your full repo)
contracts/HeartDiseaseOracle.sol:

The Solidity smart contract that implements Chainlink Functions.
Receives prediction data, triggers the off-chain computation via Chainlink Functions, and updates its on-chain state (s_lastPredictionResult) with the verified result.
Link to contracts/HeartDiseaseOracle.sol (Assuming your contract is here)
abi/HeartDiseaseOracle.json:

Contains the ABI for HeartDiseaseOracle.sol, enabling web3.py to interact with it.
